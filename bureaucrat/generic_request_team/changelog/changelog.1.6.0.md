- Changed the meaning of filter *Unassigned* on request:
  - Before this version, it showed requests that had no assigned
    users (*does not matter if request have assigned team or not*).
  - After this change, it will show requests, that
    do not have assigned user **and** do not have assigned team.
- Added new filters:
  - *No user assigned* - Show all requests that are not assigned to user
  - *No team assigned* - Show all requests that are not assigned to team
