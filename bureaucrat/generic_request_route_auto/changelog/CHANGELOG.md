# Changelog

## Version 3.15.0

After this change if request is closed via trigger and route requires response and route has default response,
then that default response will be automatically set on request.

## Version 3.5.0

Fixed access right issue, when user who triggered event does not have access to request that handles the event.
This happens for example, when some user that does not have access to request, changes stage of project task related to request.
Related to Q2305561
