- **FR2211960** To be consistent with other Odoo modules that use calendar,
  in this version we change behavior of *Meeting* stat-button on request form:
  now it will show all available meetings with default settings, thus user
  will see what other meetings are planned, when choosing date for new meeting.
- **FR2211960** Provide default value for the name of meeting as name of ticket.
- Provide default value for the description of meeting as request text sample (first 3 lines of request text).
