===========================

This module enhances the standard Todo application with powerful automation features to streamline task management. Key functionalities include:

- **Automated Server Actions**: Trigger predefined server actions automatically when a Todo item is created, started, canceled, or marked as done.
- **Auto-Start Next Todo**: Once a Todo item reaches the "done" state, the next item in the sequence is automatically started, ensuring a smooth workflow.
- **Auto-Start on Creation**: Todo items can be automatically initiated as soon as they are created, reducing manual intervention and speeding up the process.
